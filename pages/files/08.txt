I never used to think much about butter. To me, it was just something that I used to spread on bread and make food more enjoyable. But, lately, butter has taken on a new meaning for me.
When I think of butter now, I think of warmth and comfort. The smooth texture and creamy flavor soothes my soul in a way that nothing else can. I think back to all the times when I’ve gone home, feeling cold and lonely from the outside world and just had a piece of toast with a generous helping of butter—and suddenly everything just melts away.
Butter is also a reminder of my family and friends, those who have been there for me through the good times and bad. Even though many miles separate us now, I still feel close to them when I see a jar of butter on my kitchen counter. It’s like they’re with me in spirit, encouraging me to be strong and reminding me that no matter how tough things get, they will always be there for me.
The more time passes, the more deeply I appreciate butter—for its flavor, its comfort...and its sentimentality. To me it’s so much more than just something to put on toast; it’s an old friend that never leaves my side.
