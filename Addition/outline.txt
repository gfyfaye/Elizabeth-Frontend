The site is located at: http://the-singularity-show.com/
It points to the three pages that are relevant to the work.
On the site, there is a folder called “Playground”
It has three HMTL files (Kiosk, Elizabeth, and Multiple), three java script files, and a style sheet.
In theory, we can send text to a page (using its name, set in the HTML) using an API that posts from python and then is read by the page.
Also in theory, we can: change gaze, change expressions, change the background image, add in a new image.
When we have two avatars on sperate page, we want to be able to coordinate their speaking by having them:
Check if they are allowed to speak by checking if any other avatar is speaking. 
If allowed, note that they are speaking (blocking others).
Note that they are finished when done.
When we have a page with multiple possible avatars, we want to be able to switch between them.
Nothing quite works.
Starting with the Kiosk, I want to be able to:
First and foremost, have it talk again.
Change expressions 
Change background
Add an image
Once the Kiosk is stable, we want to add in Elizabeth and consider multiple pages (and coordinate speaking)
After that, we want to move to Multiple and consider switching between avatars.
The file ClassCode.py has the beginnings of the test suite you will need.
In the Playground folder, there is a file “schema.txt” that has the framework for using the core APIs.
I want everything to work, work well, and be extensible.
